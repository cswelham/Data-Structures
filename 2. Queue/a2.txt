queue - a list where new items can only be added at one end, and old items only come off the other end. Adding is called the enqueue operation, and removal is called the dequeue operation, or sometimes just put and get.  This results in a list that is in first-in-first-out order (i.e. FIFO).  Queues also typically support an operation to look at the item at the head of the list without removing it.  Queues are useful for simulations of discrete event systems (e.g. queued servers, assembly lines) or for processing jobs in the order they arrived (e.g. a printer queue, sequentially dependent tasks).
