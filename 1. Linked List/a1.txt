A list, like a set, is a collection of items.  Unlike a set, a list may have duplicate values/items, and items in a list are ordered in some way (even if the order is random) in the sense that there is a first item, a last item, an i-th item (for some integer i), and so forth.
As an abstract data type, a list supports operations like add, remove, has_Item (or the equivalent 'contains'), is_empty?, first_item, i-th_item, length, and so on.  If the list is ordered by value then it typically supports an insert operation as well (i.e. add in the correct place to maintain order).  If it is ordered by usage then it may have add_to_front and/or add_to_end as well.
